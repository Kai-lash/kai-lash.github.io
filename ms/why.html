					<h2>Why Microsoft?</h2>
					<p>This has its root in my early days when every time I started a computer I saw that one name flashing - Microsoft. It was hard to imagine life without Windows and MS office products. When you see a company making so much impact on people's lives, you certainly get emotionally attached to it. Through Microsoft, I want to touch millions of lives by creating something for the betterment of the people. I am looking to advance my career to work on more challenging tasks and modern technologies. The opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds, work on innovative projects, and be a part of an amazing culture excites me. Talking about loyalty, I am not even trying to apply to any other companies. So why now? I never thought that I could get into Microsoft, not because of my ability, but because of my belief. Over the last few years, I have been working on my self-belief, and here I am. So what have I done?
Since last year and a half, I have been learning about Microsoft Azure. Along the way, I did achieve numerous <a href ="https://www.credly.com/users/kailash-joshi/badges" >certifications</a>. This has helped me tremendously to understand and know the Microsoft Azure offerings and has further reinforced my motivation to work for Microsoft.</p>

					<h2>Exposure to Microsoft Identity Platform</h2>
<p>As a part of my preparation for Azure Solution Architect Certification, I got introduced to different Microsoft Identity concepts like Azure AD, ADConnect, AADS, ADFS, B2B, B2C, etc. Practicing these concepts gave me a clear understanding of their application and benefits.  I hope some of this learning would be useful for this role.</p>

					<h2>Why should you hire me?</h2>
					<li>Ability to get things done - As a solutions lead, I make sure our sprint commitments are always completed.</li>
<li>Problem solver - my team members look up to me to resolve any technical issue with their work. And I have never let them down.</li>
<li>Proactive and quick learner - lesser time to start making contributions once I join.
<li>Fast delivery - I am known to deliver a product feature with a quick turnaround time.</li>

					<h2>Am I culturally fit?</h2>
					<p>People see me as calm, focused, and goal-oriented. I am also popular for my dad's jokes and puns :)
I like to read self-help books and take Udemy courses related to leadership and communication skills.
When I am not working or learning technical topics, then I spend time playing music (Guitar and Digital Piano) or solving Rubik's cube (my current best is under 2 mins.)</p>
