					<h2>Why Microsoft?</h2>
					<p>This has its root in my early days when every time I started a computer I saw that one name flashing - Microsoft. It was hard to imagine life without Windows and MS office products. When you see a company making so much impact on people's lives, you certainly get emotionally attached to it. Through Microsoft, I want to touch millions of lives by creating something for the betterment of the people. I am looking to advance my career to work on more challenging tasks and modern technologies. The opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds, work on innovative projects, and be a part of an amazing culture excites me. Talking about loyalty, I am not even trying to apply to any other company. So why now? I never thought that I could get into Microsoft, not because of my ability, but because of my belief. Over the last few years, I have been working on my self-belief, and here I am. So what have I done?
Since last year and a half, I have been learning about Microsoft Azure. Along the way, I did achieve numerous <a href ="https://www.credly.com/users/kailash-joshi/badges" >certifications</a>. Lately, for the purpose of this interview, I am familiarizing myself with the Power platform offerings, and web stacks like React, Typescript, GraphQL, etc.</p>

					<h2>Why Power Platform?</h2>
					<p>It is exciting to work on products that enable less technical people to create apps, automate them, and visualize their data without much code. Working with connectors to get data from various sources, building bots, and infusing AI into the apps sounds fascinating to me. This is the kind of work where I feel I can provide maximum value and work to my full potential.</p>

					<h2>Why should you hire me?</h2>
					<li>Ability to get things done - As a solutions lead, I make sure our sprint commitments are always completed.</li>
<li>Problem solver - my team members look up to me to resolve any technical issue with their work. And I have never let them down.</li>
<li>Proactive and quick learner - lesser time to start making contributions once I join.
<li>Fast delivery - I am known to deliver a product feature with a quick turnaround time.</li>

					<h2>Am I culturally fit?</h2>
					<p>People see me as calm, focused, and goal-oriented. I am also popular for my dad's jokes and puns :)
When I am not working or learning technical topics, then I spend time playing music (Guitar and Digital Piano) or solving Rubik's cube (my current best is under 2 mins.)</p>
